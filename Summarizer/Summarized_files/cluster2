Over the past years, lycorine has attracted great research interest owing to its superlative biological potential and pharmacological actions, including antiangiogenic, antiviral, antibacterial, antimalarial, anti-parasite, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, analgesic, anti-inflammatory activities, and inhibition of ascorbic acid synthesis (Kim et al., 2008; Lamoral-Theys et al., 2009; Cedron et al., 2010; Giordani et al., 2011; Citoglu et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Cembrowska-Lech & Kepczynski, 2016; Bendaif et al., 2018) .
Subsequent studies found that lycorine exhibits antiviral activity toward herpes simplex virus (Renard-Nozaki et al., 1989) , HIV-1 (Lin et al., 1995) , coronavirus (Li et al., 2005) , poliovirus (Hwang et al., 2008) , West Nile Virus, dengue and yellow fever viruses (Zou et al., 2009) , enterovirus 71 (Liu et al., 2011) , influenza virus (He et al., 2013) , hepatitis C virus (Guo et al., 2016) , and adult zika virus (Masi et al., 2016) .
Using various genetic resources (Al-Swailem et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2014; Fitak et al., 2016), few studies have recently started to investigate the genetic basis of camel phenotypic and behavioral traits (Holl et al., 2017; Almathen et al., 2018; Ramadan et al., 2018); mostly using the candidate gene(s) sequencing approach (Zhu and Zhao, 2007).
The KIT gene has been identified or implicated to be related to white color or white-spotting in alpacas (Jackling et al., 2014), cows (Fontanesi et al., 2010), yaks (Zhang et al., 2014), pigs (Cho et al., 2011), goats (Nazari-Ghadikolaei et al., 2018), horses (Hauswirth et al., 2013), donkeys (Haase et al., 2015), cats (David et al., 2014), dogs (Wong et al., 2012), mice (Geissler et al., 1988), and rabbits (Fontanesi et al., 2014).
Fibroblast growth factor-5 (FGF5) has been identified to be associated with, or responsible for, long hair in many mammals, including llamas (Daverio et al., 2017), alpacas (Pallotti et al., 2018), donkeys (Legrand et al., 2014), sheep (Zhang et al., 2015), goats (Wang et al., 2016), cats (Drögemüller et al., 2007), dogs (Dierks et al., 2013), rabbits (Mulsant et al., 2010), mice (Hébert et al., 1994), and humans (Higgins et al., 2014).
The detection of EGFRvIII RNA in glioma EVs was also reported by Nilsson et al, and they found that EVs are used to transfer the message to recipient cells.42 The work of Chen et al is promising in its potential to use the detection of the IDH1 mutation in CSF as a biomarker, especially considering the sensitivity of this technique.70 The authors used very sensitive PCR methods to detect and quantify wild-type and mutant IDH1 transcripts in EVs isolated from the CSF of glioma patients and found higher levels of mutant IDH1 in the CSF of patients with gliomas compared with healthy controls.
Determine the site (e.g., extension/metastasis to other organs or privileged sites) and extent of disease Provide information on the class of the infectious pathogen, which could help in targeted empiric antimicrobial treatments Monitoring and prognostication Preclinical Noninvasive longitudinal assessments, especially in studies utilizing larger, more expensive animal species; serial assessments in the same animal could significantly reduce sample size, inter-animal variability (outbreed animals), and therefore cost of the studies Clinical trials Early end points for treatment trials to assess activity of treatments and to predict stable cure Assessing host-directed treatments for infections Enable adaptive designs Patient settings Rapidly detect treatment failures due to drug-resistant organisms or other reasons Rapidly monitor treatment responses in patients with drug-resistant organisms and individualize treatments Early end points for duration of treatment and predict stable cure enabling precision medicine Public health Rapid determination of the infectious risk of a patient to the population based on response to treatment and extent and location of disease Rapid diagnosis and monitoring of biothreat agents infected tissues, rather than serum alone.
A series of studies (Li et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2005b; Li et al., 2005c; Li et al., 2006a; Li et al., 2006b; Li et al., 2006c; and Li et al., 2006d) have shown that there is a distinctive difference in the interaction features between the larch forest in the upper watershed and the steppe grassland, although the general seasonal trend is essentially the same.
