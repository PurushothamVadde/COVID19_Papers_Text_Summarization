Whereas development of anti-cancer and anti-viral nucleosides has typically involved relatively minor modification of the base, studies to examine expanding the genetic code and elucidate how polymerases differentiate right from wrong (d)NTPs have involved both small and large base modifications (Berdis and McCutcheon, 2007 , Cavanaugh, et al., 2009 , Henry, et al., 2004 , Kim, et al., 2005 , Kincaid, et al., 2005 , Kool, 2002 , Leconte, et al., 2008 , Lee and Berdis, 2009 , Lee, et al., 2008 , Matsuda, et al., 2003 , Meyer, et al., 2004 , Morales and Kool, 1998 , Ogawa, et al., 2000 , Patro, et al., 2009 , Ramirez-Aguilar and Kuchta, 2004 , Sintim and Kool, 2006 , Thompson and Kuchta, 1995 , Washington, et al., 2003 , Zhang, et al., 2005 .
The most extensive data on the effects of substrate modifications exists for Klenow Fragment (an A family enzyme), herpes and human DNA primase, and three B family polymerases (Pol α, herpes DNA pol, and T4 DNA pol) (Berdis and McCutcheon, 2007 , Cavanaugh, et al., 2009 , Henry, et al., 2004 , Kim, et al., 2005 , Kincaid, et al., 2005 , Kool, 2002 , Leconte, et al., 2008 , Lee and Berdis, 2009 , Lee, et al., 2008 , Matsuda, et al., 2003 , Meyer, et al., 2004 , Morales and Kool, 1998 , Ogawa, et al., 2000 , Patro, et al., 2009 , Ramirez-Aguilar and Kuchta, 2004 , Sintim and Kool, 2006 , Thompson and Kuchta, 1995 , Washington, et al., 2003 , Zhang, et al., 2005 .
Effect on inflammation/immunity GH + basal proliferation of lymphoid cells and maturation of bone marrow derived cells (Savino, 2007) + neutrophils differentiation (Savino, 2007) + production of pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a (Savino et al., 2003; Tsigos et al., 1997) + T-cells cytotoxic activity, NK-cells activity (Shimizu et al., 2005) + T-cells migration and adhesion (Savino and Dardenne, 2000) + release of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) from macrophages (Dekaris et al., 1998) + thymulin production (Savino et al., 2003) GCs À leukocyte trafficking (Pitzalis et al., 1997) À chemotaxis and migration of neutrophils and monocyte; circulating numbers of monocytes and monocyte (Webster et al., 2002) À inflammatory signaling pathway (NF-kB, AP-1) (Webster et al., 2002) À inhibition of DC differentiation and MHC expression (Woltman et al., 2002; Matyszak et al., 2000) À priming of the antigen specific response of CD8+ lymphocytes against viruses (Dobbs et al., 1993; Truckenmiller et al., 2006) À production of inflammatory mediators (COX-2, iNOS, A2 phospolipase, 15-lipoxigenase) and of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-12, GM-CSF, TNF-a, IFN-g) (Webster et al., 2002) À proliferation and activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Bonneau et al., 1998 ) + Th2 response: IL-4, IL-10 production, inhibition of IL-12 (Agarwal and Marshal, 2001; Webster et al., 2002; Elenkov and Chrousos, 1999 ) + thymocyte and lymphocyte apoptosis (Migliorati et al., 1994; Herold et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006) IGF-1 + differentiation and proliferation of myeloid cells (Lin et al., 1997 ) + anti-apoptotic factor for myeloid lineage cells (innate immunity cells (Burgess et al., 2003; Clark, 1997) ) + NK-cell activity (Kooijmann et al., 1996) + in situ production of TNF-a from activated macrophages (Renier et al., 1996) + proliferation of lymphocytes T/B in lymphoid organs (van Buul-Offers and Kooijmann, 1998) + differentiation of thymic T-cell progenitors (Gjerset et al., 1990 ) + differentiation of pro-B lymphocytes in the bone marrow (Funk et al., 1994) Leptin + lymphopoiesis; survival of CD4+CD8+ and CD4+CD8-thymocytes (Lam and Lu, 2007) + NK differentiation, proliferation and activity (Tian et al., 2002) + polarization of Th1 response in effector cells; anergie and hyporesponsiveness in CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells; proliferation of CD4+ CD25À T cells (De Rosa et al., 2007) + activities of monocyte (NO and cytokines production: TNF-a, IFN-g) (Mancuso et al., 2004; Otero et al., 2006) + oxidative stress in endothelial cells (Bouloumie et al., 1999) + stimulation activity of neutrophils (Caldefie-Chezet et al., 2003) + survival, maturation and cytokine production of Dendritic Cells (DC) (Lam et al., 2006) Zn-Thymulin + thymocyte differentiation + NK activity + IL-2 production by T-cells + T-cells cytotoxicity and suppressor function (Savino and Dardenne, 2000; Meazza et al., 2007; Prasad, 2008; Onodera et al., 1994; Molly and Marsh, 2003; Mocchegiani et al., 2006) practices, environmental stressors, nutritional factors) can influence the development and the activation of immune responses in terms of functional efficiency.
However, studies in clinical trials and large animal models, including our studies, which delivered AAV2-TNFRII-FC into baboon hearts (McTiernan et al., 2007) , have revealed a range of inflammatory immune responses to AAV vectors and their transgene products, which may reduce transgene expression (Herzog et al., 2001 (Herzog et al., , 2002 Wang et al., 2005 Wang et al., , 2007a Jiang et al., 2006; Manno et al., 2006; Mingozzi and High, 2007) and raise the risks associated with AAV-based gene delivery procedures.
Direct injection of AAV into primate hearts (McTiernan et al., 2007) and dog skeletal muscle (Yuasa et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005 Wang et al., , 2007a induces a cellular infiltration, whereas the inflammatory response to catheterdelivered cardiac AAV infusion is not notable (Kaplitt et al., 1996; Kawase et al., 2008; Raake et al., 2008) .
In this light it is interesting to note that (1) several studies have observed an unexpected and prolonged (weeks to months) persistence of, and cellular responses to, viral antigens after infection with parvovirus B19 (Isa et al., 2005) , vesicular stomatitis virus (Turner et al., 2007) , or influenza virus (Kim et al., 2010);  (2) some studies suggest long-term persistence of AAV-antigens after viral delivery ( Jiang et al., 2006; Stieger et al., 2009) ; and (3) even low levels of viral capsid antigen:MHC complexes can target cells for recognition by peptide-specific cytotoxic T cells (Pien et al., 2009) .
Additionally, delivery of the S antigen by way of DNA vaccination, nanoparticles, recombinant viral vectors such as modified vaccinia Ankara or adenovirus or RBD-based subunit vaccines have shown immunogenicity and efficacy in mice and/or NHPs against MERS-CoV challenge (Du et al., 2013b; Muthumani et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Coleman et al., 2014; Song et al., 2013; Volz et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2014 Lan et al., , 2015 .
Finally, an eIF4E level increase was observed in the following human tumors: breast, bladder, colon, lung, skin, head and neck, ovarian, and prostate cancer, compared to healthy tissues (Berkel et al., 2001; Coleman et al., 2009; Crew et al., 2000; Graff et al., 2009; Holm et al., 2008; Matthews-Greer et al., 2005; Nathan et al., 2004; Salehi, Mashayekhi, & Shahosseini, 2007; Thumma & Kratzke, 2007; Wang et al., 2009) .
