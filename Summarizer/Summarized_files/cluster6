Although human IFN-ω (HuIFN-ω) can exert in vivo antitumor effects in several models of human cancer (Horton et al., 1999) , Feline IFN-ω (FeIFN-ω) shows a proven antiviral effect, both in vitro (Mochizuki et al., 1994; Ohe et al., 2008; Litzlbauer et al., 2014) and in vivo Leal et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2002; Horton et al., 1999; Mochizuki et al., 1994; Ohe et al., 2008; Litzlbauer et al., 2014) , against canine and feline parvovirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus, and has been licensed for use in veterinary medicine (Virbagen®, Virbac) in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico (Domenech et al., 2011) .

It is worth noting that the theory, and details, behind alternative protein structure determination and validation methods are not discussed here and, hence, the reader is referred instead to an extensive collection of such methods (Vriend, 1990; Günter et al., 1991; Lüthy et al., 1992; Laskowski et al., 1993; Günter 1998; Cornilescu et al., 1998; Brünger et al., 1998; Lovell et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2005 Huang et al., , 2006 Nabuurs et al., 2006; Brünger, 2007; Davis et al., 2007; Bhattacharya et al, 2007; Cavalli, et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2008; Günter 2009; Rosato et al., 2009; Frank et al., 2011; Guerry and Herrmann, 2011; Rosatto et al., 2012) .
For each amino acid residue X in the protein sequence: (a) the 13 C α shielding depends, mainly, on its own backbone conformations (Spera and Bax, 1991; deDios et al., 1993; Kuszewski et al., 1995) and side-chain (Iwadate et al., 1999; Havlin et al., 1997; Pearson et al., 1997; Villegas et al., 2007) , with no significant influence of either the amino acid sequence or the position of the given residue in the sequence, except for residues preceding proline ; (b) each amino acid residue X in the protein sequence can be treated as a terminally blocked tripeptide with the sequence Ac-GXG-NMe, with X in the conformation of the protein structure; (c) the 13 C α isotropic shielding values (σ) for each amino acid residue X can be computed at the OB98/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory with the Gaussian 03 package (Frisch et al., 2004) .
Subsequently, use of NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and theoretical studies, based on QM calculations, have continuously evolved in their ability to determine properties of the histidine residues in solution and in the solid state (Meadow et al., 1968; Reynolds et al., 1973; Markley 1975; Wüthrich, 1976; Schuster and Roberts, 1979; Harbison et al., 1981; Munowitz et al., 1986; Bachovchin, 1986; Farr-Jones et al., 1993; Pelton et al., 1993; Steiner, 1996; Steiner and Koellner, 1997; Shimba et al., 1998 Shimba et al., , 2003 Sudmeier et al., 2003; Strohmeier et al., 2003; Cheng et al., 2005; Shimahara et al., 2007; Jensen et al., 2007; Hass et al., 2008; Hass et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2010; Vila et al., 2011) .
Likewise, the known ribosome structures stem from three different extremophiles-T. thermophilus (Cate et al., 1999; Clemons et al., 1999; Tocilj et al., 1999) , Haloarcula marismortui (Ban et al., 1999; Gluehmann et al., 2001) , and Deinococcus radiodurans (Davidovich et al., 2007) -and were solved as the result of years of intensive and innovative worldwide research efforts (e.g., Moore and Steitz, 2003; Noller, 1991; Wilson and Nierhaus, 2006; Yonath et al., 1998; Yusupov et al., 1991) .
