The budding capacity of virus proteins as VLPs, the protein-protein interactions that facilitate this process, and the central role of M protein in VLP assembly and release has been described for several paramyxoviruses such as Sendai virus (SeV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (PIV-5) and human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV1) [20], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]: The efficiency of VLP formation in virtually all these studies was based on M protein release in the supernatant.
Therefore, rules of thumb include:
Recumbent calves 12% to 15% dehydrated; base deficit 15 to 20 mEq/L Weak calves 8% to 12% dehydrated; base deficit 10 to 15 mEq/L Ambulatory calves 5% to 8% dehydrated; base deficit 5 to 10 mEq/L These rules of thumb are not absolute, and chronic lowgrade bicarbonate loss or increased D-lactate production in the gut may create profound acidosis over a period of days in a calf having only minimal signs of dehydration.
Fever may precede clinical signs of diarrhea but seldom is detected before calves begin to show diarrhea and appear ill. Fresh blood and mucus in the feces (some calves may have blood in feces before diarrhea) also are common with Salmonella enteritis (Fig.
A small proportion of C. perfringens type A strains associated with abomasal tympany and abomasitis in dairy calves are also CPB2 positive (the beta2 toxin encoding gene), so there may be some occasional therapeutic benefit to the administration of antitoxin to C. perfringens type C or the prophylactic use of toxoids against type C.
Giardia duodenalis (also referred to as G. lamblia or G. intestinalis) is a common protozoal parasite of mammals, and the increased diagnostic sensitivity of PCR over previous immunofluorescence techniques has allowed prevalence investigations in a number of dairying areas worldwide.
C. jejuni and C. coli can commonly be found in the feces of healthy calves (especially C. jejuni), and several studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of culture-positive fecal samples in dairy calves preweaning is in the range of about 15% of all calves on farm and that this rate is similar when diarrheic calves and normal calves are sampled.
Although high mortality calf diarrhea outbreaks are more typically caused by E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonella spp., occasional outbreaks may have concurrent BVDV infection, and viral isolation should be a part of the diagnostic material submitted from both live and necropsied calves in such cases (see Chapter 18).
In the United States, MAP-related average costs have been estimated to lie between $22 and $27 per cow per year, but the economic impact of the disease in positive herds versus confirmed negative herds is much higher and may exceed $100 per cow per year when infection progresses to clinical signs of disease.The 14 coronavirus sequences used here are available from GenBank under the following accession numbers: HCoV-NL63, AY567487; HCoV-229E, AF304460; PEDV, AF353511; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), AF304460; feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), AF124987; HCoV-OC43, AY391777; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), AF124988; bovine coronavirus (BCoV), AF391541; mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), X51939; sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), AF124990; canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCV), AY150273; SARS-CoV, AY313906; turkey coronavirus (TCoV), AF124991; and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Z30541.The sensitivity of the pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 RNA.
