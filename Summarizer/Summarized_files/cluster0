rapid response strategies for understanding emerging viral pathogenesis testing vaccines and therapeutics that can restrict epidemic spread and preventing morbidity and mortality are essential during the early phases of an epidemic h5n1 and h7n9 influenza viruses and coronaviruses covs are emerging human pathogens that cause severe respiratory infections often culminating in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards an endstage lung disease associated with high mortality rates 1 covs are enveloped viruses belonging to the order nidovirales and contain the largest known positivesense rna genome 30 kb 2 covs can replicate efficiently in a wide range of mammalian hosts and are divided into three major genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus cov and gammacoronavirus within these genera covs are further divided into subgroups 1a and b 2a to d and 3 3 4 covs include human covs hku1 and oc43 which cause mild to moderate respiratory disease and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov which caused an epidemic in 2002 to 2003 that resulted in 10 to 50 agedependent mortality 5 6 more recently another cov called middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov emerged in the middle east in april of 2012 causing pneumonia and ards as well as renal failure in some patients 7 8 to date merscov has spread to eight countries and has been implicated in 182 cases and 79 reported deaths with mortality rates approaching 43 especially in elderly patients 9 merscov shares a close phylogenetic relationship with the pipistrellus bat coronavirus btcov strain hku5 and tylonycteris btcov strain hku4 all three viruses are classified in cov subgroup 2c see fig s1a in the supplemental material 7 10 bats can serve as reservoirs for circulating swarms of zoonotic viruses and some are readily positioned to directly cross the species barrier and infect human populations 3 4 sarscov is believed to have originated from closely related bat predecessor strains similar to btcov hku3 although the exact precursor virus has not been identified 3 4 11 while the zoonotic source of merscov remains unknown recent reports identified the presence of covs with close amino acid similarity to merscov in nycteris and pipistrellus bat species 12 13 another study described the close similarity of merscov to btcov hku5 both of these homologous viruses share high degrees of amino acid sequence similarity across important replicase protein targets such as the 3clike protease 3clpro also known as nonstructural protein 5 nsp5 82 polymerase 92 and proofreading exonuclease 91 as well as the nucleocapsid n protein 68 7 10 a recent finding suggests that most of these proteins coevolve within subgroups of covs making them attractive targets to test in models of closely related subgroups 14 the lack of a small animal model for merscov has limited the understanding of the pathogenesis of covs belonging to subgroup 2c thereby hampering the development of vaccines and therapeutics btcov hku5 shares a high degree of genetic sequence identity with merscov in the replicase targets and n genes therefore developing a small animal model will assist us to identify viral determinants of pathogenesis and virulence explore the possibility of vaccineinduced eosinophilia for merscov vaccines and identify antivirals with broad activity against subgroup 2c strains furthermore to date no subgroup 2c bat covs have been cultured in vitro the availability of infectious clones of these viruses will help us to dissect common evolutionary relationships among pathogenic cov strains we report the in vitro reconstruction and biological characterization using reverse genetics and syntheticgenome design of an infectious clone of btcov hku5 icbtcov hku5 containing the ectodomain from the sars spike s protein btcov hku5se we show that btcov hku5se replicated efficiently and demonstrate that a small molecule inhibitor targeting 3clpro effectively inhibited btcov hku5se and merscov replication in cell culture in addition we report that btcov hku5se replicated to high titers in both young and aged mice but did not cause lifethreatening disease virus replication and disease were dependent on the presence of the mouse angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated the presence of viral antigen in epithelial cells lining the small airways and alveoli btcov hku5se replication was inhibited by sarscov s proteinbased vaccines but was not sensitive to vaccines based on s proteins from subgroup 2c covs unlike mice vaccinated with sarscov nexpressing venezuelan equine encephalitis vee virus replicon particles vrp 15 a severe eosinophilic immune pathology was not observed following btcov hku5se challenge of animals vaccinated with vrp expressing hku5 n or merscov n supporting the development of killed and recombinant protein vaccines for merscov in vivo passage of btcov hku5se in young mice resulted in selection for a mouseadapted strain btcov hku5se ma that replicated more efficiently and caused significant clinical disease that progressed to interstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage dad in aged mice mutations in nsp13 nsp14 open reading frame 5 orf5 and the m protein conferred increased virulence in mice taken together our results illustrate the utility of syntheticgenomicsbased platforms for rapidly generating a set of related zoonotic viruses identifying viral determinants of increased virulence assisting in the development of broadly active drugs and previewing potential vaccinerelated complications which could provide invaluable directions for investigations during the early phases of an epidemic we have previously described the synthetic reconstruction of a noncultivatable virus btcov hku3 16 as phylogenetic studies indicate that btcov hku5 is most closely related to merscov we used published sequence information to synthesize an infectious molecular clone for btcov hku5 icbtcov hku5 16 17 the genome of the virus was synthesized as six contiguous cdna fragments as shown in fig 1a and each subclone was flanked by class ii restriction endonucleases that allow for directed assembly of a fulllength cdna genome which encodes a t7 start at the 5 end and a polyt tract at the 3 end full-length rnas were generated using in vitro transcription of ligated cdnas .
493 a recent study has identified mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5  gene in patients with polycystic liver disease.
onset of liver disease is usually later; most cases are diagnosed after 30 years of age, although liver disease can become evident in adolescence.
it is not entirely clear to what extent the heterozygous state of α1-at deficiency contributes to liver disease in the setting of another chronic liver disease, but in one large study, α1-at heterozygosity was associated with an increased risk of liver decompensation in individuals with hepatitis c or fatty liver disease.
ursodeoxycholic acid  may significantly improve clinical status and liver test results in some children, but no beneficial effect was shown in children with the most severe liver disease.
1377, 1390 liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with severe variants, progressive liver disease, and for some patients whose disease manifestations have proved very difficult to control with conventional therapy.
in the most common and classic form of the disease, type i, patients present between 2 weeks and 4 months of age.
they described three clinical phenotypes, based on age at presentation and course: an infantile type presenting before 6 months of age with jaundice and failure to thrive; a childhood type presenting between 1 and 5 years of age with liver dysfunction that progressed to liver failure and death within 6 months; and a classic type with variable onset of liver disease but progressive neurological deterioration.
in patients with non-severe disease.
 mpv infection was associated with mild severity of disease in our study, but patients, especially young children, have a relatively long hospitalization time , compared to children with other viruses except rsv and rhv.
