### Summary of Cluster0

rapid response strategies for understanding emerging viral pathogenesis testing vaccines and therapeutics that can restrict epidemic spread and preventing morbidity and mortality are essential during the early phases of an epidemic h5n1 and h7n9 influenza viruses and coronaviruses covs are emerging human pathogens that cause severe respiratory infections often culminating in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards an endstage lung disease associated with high mortality rates 1 covs are enveloped viruses belonging to the order nidovirales and contain the largest known positivesense rna genome 30 kb 2 covs can replicate efficiently in a wide range of mammalian hosts and are divided into three major genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus cov and gammacoronavirus within these genera covs are further divided into subgroups 1a and b 2a to d and 3 3 4 covs include human covs hku1 and oc43 which cause mild to moderate respiratory disease and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov which caused an epidemic in 2002 to 2003 that resulted in 10 to 50 agedependent mortality 5 6 more recently another cov called middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov emerged in the middle east in april of 2012 causing pneumonia and ards as well as renal failure in some patients 7 8 to date merscov has spread to eight countries and has been implicated in 182 cases and 79 reported deaths with mortality rates approaching 43 especially in elderly patients 9 merscov shares a close phylogenetic relationship with the pipistrellus bat coronavirus btcov strain hku5 and tylonycteris btcov strain hku4 all three viruses are classified in cov subgroup 2c see fig s1a in the supplemental material 7 10 bats can serve as reservoirs for circulating swarms of zoonotic viruses and some are readily positioned to directly cross the species barrier and infect human populations 3 4 sarscov is believed to have originated from closely related bat predecessor strains similar to btcov hku3 although the exact precursor virus has not been identified 3 4 11 while the zoonotic source of merscov remains unknown recent reports identified the presence of covs with close amino acid similarity to merscov in nycteris and pipistrellus bat species 12 13 another study described the close similarity of merscov to btcov hku5 both of these homologous viruses share high degrees of amino acid sequence similarity across important replicase protein targets such as the 3clike protease 3clpro also known as nonstructural protein 5 nsp5 82 polymerase 92 and proofreading exonuclease 91 as well as the nucleocapsid n protein 68 7 10 a recent finding suggests that most of these proteins coevolve within subgroups of covs making them attractive targets to test in models of closely related subgroups 14 the lack of a small animal model for merscov has limited the understanding of the pathogenesis of covs belonging to subgroup 2c thereby hampering the development of vaccines and therapeutics btcov hku5 shares a high degree of genetic sequence identity with merscov in the replicase targets and n genes therefore developing a small animal model will assist us to identify viral determinants of pathogenesis and virulence explore the possibility of vaccineinduced eosinophilia for merscov vaccines and identify antivirals with broad activity against subgroup 2c strains furthermore to date no subgroup 2c bat covs have been cultured in vitro the availability of infectious clones of these viruses will help us to dissect common evolutionary relationships among pathogenic cov strains we report the in vitro reconstruction and biological characterization using reverse genetics and syntheticgenome design of an infectious clone of btcov hku5 icbtcov hku5 containing the ectodomain from the sars spike s protein btcov hku5se we show that btcov hku5se replicated efficiently and demonstrate that a small molecule inhibitor targeting 3clpro effectively inhibited btcov hku5se and merscov replication in cell culture in addition we report that btcov hku5se replicated to high titers in both young and aged mice but did not cause lifethreatening disease virus replication and disease were dependent on the presence of the mouse angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated the presence of viral antigen in epithelial cells lining the small airways and alveoli btcov hku5se replication was inhibited by sarscov s proteinbased vaccines but was not sensitive to vaccines based on s proteins from subgroup 2c covs unlike mice vaccinated with sarscov nexpressing venezuelan equine encephalitis vee virus replicon particles vrp 15 a severe eosinophilic immune pathology was not observed following btcov hku5se challenge of animals vaccinated with vrp expressing hku5 n or merscov n supporting the development of killed and recombinant protein vaccines for merscov in vivo passage of btcov hku5se in young mice resulted in selection for a mouseadapted strain btcov hku5se ma that replicated more efficiently and caused significant clinical disease that progressed to interstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage dad in aged mice mutations in nsp13 nsp14 open reading frame 5 orf5 and the m protein conferred increased virulence in mice taken together our results illustrate the utility of syntheticgenomicsbased platforms for rapidly generating a set of related zoonotic viruses identifying viral determinants of increased virulence assisting in the development of broadly active drugs and previewing potential vaccinerelated complications which could provide invaluable directions for investigations during the early phases of an epidemic we have previously described the synthetic reconstruction of a noncultivatable virus btcov hku3 16 as phylogenetic studies indicate that btcov hku5 is most closely related to merscov we used published sequence information to synthesize an infectious molecular clone for btcov hku5 icbtcov hku5 16 17 the genome of the virus was synthesized as six contiguous cdna fragments as shown in fig 1a and each subclone was flanked by class ii restriction endonucleases that allow for directed assembly of a fulllength cdna genome which encodes a t7 start at the 5 end and a polyt tract at the 3 end full-length rnas were generated using in vitro transcription of ligated cdnas .
493 a recent study has identified mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5  gene in patients with polycystic liver disease.
onset of liver disease is usually later; most cases are diagnosed after 30 years of age, although liver disease can become evident in adolescence.
it is not entirely clear to what extent the heterozygous state of α1-at deficiency contributes to liver disease in the setting of another chronic liver disease, but in one large study, α1-at heterozygosity was associated with an increased risk of liver decompensation in individuals with hepatitis c or fatty liver disease.
ursodeoxycholic acid  may significantly improve clinical status and liver test results in some children, but no beneficial effect was shown in children with the most severe liver disease.
1377, 1390 liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with severe variants, progressive liver disease, and for some patients whose disease manifestations have proved very difficult to control with conventional therapy.
in the most common and classic form of the disease, type i, patients present between 2 weeks and 4 months of age.
they described three clinical phenotypes, based on age at presentation and course: an infantile type presenting before 6 months of age with jaundice and failure to thrive; a childhood type presenting between 1 and 5 years of age with liver dysfunction that progressed to liver failure and death within 6 months; and a classic type with variable onset of liver disease but progressive neurological deterioration.
in patients with non-severe disease.
 mpv infection was associated with mild severity of disease in our study, but patients, especially young children, have a relatively long hospitalization time , compared to children with other viruses except rsv and rhv.
##Summary of Cluster1
The budding capacity of virus proteins as VLPs, the protein-protein interactions that facilitate this process, and the central role of M protein in VLP assembly and release has been described for several paramyxoviruses such as Sendai virus (SeV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (PIV-5) and human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV1) [20], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]: The efficiency of VLP formation in virtually all these studies was based on M protein release in the supernatant.
Therefore, rules of thumb include:
Recumbent calves 12% to 15% dehydrated; base deficit 15 to 20 mEq/L Weak calves 8% to 12% dehydrated; base deficit 10 to 15 mEq/L Ambulatory calves 5% to 8% dehydrated; base deficit 5 to 10 mEq/L These rules of thumb are not absolute, and chronic lowgrade bicarbonate loss or increased D-lactate production in the gut may create profound acidosis over a period of days in a calf having only minimal signs of dehydration.
Fever may precede clinical signs of diarrhea but seldom is detected before calves begin to show diarrhea and appear ill. Fresh blood and mucus in the feces (some calves may have blood in feces before diarrhea) also are common with Salmonella enteritis (Fig.
A small proportion of C. perfringens type A strains associated with abomasal tympany and abomasitis in dairy calves are also CPB2 positive (the beta2 toxin encoding gene), so there may be some occasional therapeutic benefit to the administration of antitoxin to C. perfringens type C or the prophylactic use of toxoids against type C.
Giardia duodenalis (also referred to as G. lamblia or G. intestinalis) is a common protozoal parasite of mammals, and the increased diagnostic sensitivity of PCR over previous immunofluorescence techniques has allowed prevalence investigations in a number of dairying areas worldwide.
C. jejuni and C. coli can commonly be found in the feces of healthy calves (especially C. jejuni), and several studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of culture-positive fecal samples in dairy calves preweaning is in the range of about 15% of all calves on farm and that this rate is similar when diarrheic calves and normal calves are sampled.
Although high mortality calf diarrhea outbreaks are more typically caused by E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonella spp., occasional outbreaks may have concurrent BVDV infection, and viral isolation should be a part of the diagnostic material submitted from both live and necropsied calves in such cases (see Chapter 18).
In the United States, MAP-related average costs have been estimated to lie between $22 and $27 per cow per year, but the economic impact of the disease in positive herds versus confirmed negative herds is much higher and may exceed $100 per cow per year when infection progresses to clinical signs of disease.The 14 coronavirus sequences used here are available from GenBank under the following accession numbers: HCoV-NL63, AY567487; HCoV-229E, AF304460; PEDV, AF353511; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), AF304460; feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), AF124987; HCoV-OC43, AY391777; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), AF124988; bovine coronavirus (BCoV), AF391541; mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), X51939; sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), AF124990; canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCV), AY150273; SARS-CoV, AY313906; turkey coronavirus (TCoV), AF124991; and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Z30541.The sensitivity of the pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 RNA.
##Summary of Cluster2
Over the past years, lycorine has attracted great research interest owing to its superlative biological potential and pharmacological actions, including antiangiogenic, antiviral, antibacterial, antimalarial, anti-parasite, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, analgesic, anti-inflammatory activities, and inhibition of ascorbic acid synthesis (Kim et al., 2008; Lamoral-Theys et al., 2009; Cedron et al., 2010; Giordani et al., 2011; Citoglu et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Cembrowska-Lech & Kepczynski, 2016; Bendaif et al., 2018) .
Subsequent studies found that lycorine exhibits antiviral activity toward herpes simplex virus (Renard-Nozaki et al., 1989) , HIV-1 (Lin et al., 1995) , coronavirus (Li et al., 2005) , poliovirus (Hwang et al., 2008) , West Nile Virus, dengue and yellow fever viruses (Zou et al., 2009) , enterovirus 71 (Liu et al., 2011) , influenza virus (He et al., 2013) , hepatitis C virus (Guo et al., 2016) , and adult zika virus (Masi et al., 2016) .
Using various genetic resources (Al-Swailem et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2014; Fitak et al., 2016), few studies have recently started to investigate the genetic basis of camel phenotypic and behavioral traits (Holl et al., 2017; Almathen et al., 2018; Ramadan et al., 2018); mostly using the candidate gene(s) sequencing approach (Zhu and Zhao, 2007).
The KIT gene has been identified or implicated to be related to white color or white-spotting in alpacas (Jackling et al., 2014), cows (Fontanesi et al., 2010), yaks (Zhang et al., 2014), pigs (Cho et al., 2011), goats (Nazari-Ghadikolaei et al., 2018), horses (Hauswirth et al., 2013), donkeys (Haase et al., 2015), cats (David et al., 2014), dogs (Wong et al., 2012), mice (Geissler et al., 1988), and rabbits (Fontanesi et al., 2014).
Fibroblast growth factor-5 (FGF5) has been identified to be associated with, or responsible for, long hair in many mammals, including llamas (Daverio et al., 2017), alpacas (Pallotti et al., 2018), donkeys (Legrand et al., 2014), sheep (Zhang et al., 2015), goats (Wang et al., 2016), cats (Drögemüller et al., 2007), dogs (Dierks et al., 2013), rabbits (Mulsant et al., 2010), mice (Hébert et al., 1994), and humans (Higgins et al., 2014).
The detection of EGFRvIII RNA in glioma EVs was also reported by Nilsson et al, and they found that EVs are used to transfer the message to recipient cells.42 The work of Chen et al is promising in its potential to use the detection of the IDH1 mutation in CSF as a biomarker, especially considering the sensitivity of this technique.70 The authors used very sensitive PCR methods to detect and quantify wild-type and mutant IDH1 transcripts in EVs isolated from the CSF of glioma patients and found higher levels of mutant IDH1 in the CSF of patients with gliomas compared with healthy controls.
Determine the site (e.g., extension/metastasis to other organs or privileged sites) and extent of disease Provide information on the class of the infectious pathogen, which could help in targeted empiric antimicrobial treatments Monitoring and prognostication Preclinical Noninvasive longitudinal assessments, especially in studies utilizing larger, more expensive animal species; serial assessments in the same animal could significantly reduce sample size, inter-animal variability (outbreed animals), and therefore cost of the studies Clinical trials Early end points for treatment trials to assess activity of treatments and to predict stable cure Assessing host-directed treatments for infections Enable adaptive designs Patient settings Rapidly detect treatment failures due to drug-resistant organisms or other reasons Rapidly monitor treatment responses in patients with drug-resistant organisms and individualize treatments Early end points for duration of treatment and predict stable cure enabling precision medicine Public health Rapid determination of the infectious risk of a patient to the population based on response to treatment and extent and location of disease Rapid diagnosis and monitoring of biothreat agents infected tissues, rather than serum alone.
A series of studies (Li et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2005b; Li et al., 2005c; Li et al., 2006a; Li et al., 2006b; Li et al., 2006c; and Li et al., 2006d) have shown that there is a distinctive difference in the interaction features between the larch forest in the upper watershed and the steppe grassland, although the general seasonal trend is essentially the same.
##Summary of Cluster3
The CD8 รท cells were suspected" of acting as cytotoxic effector cells, and recent data demonstrating that CD8 รท cytotoxic T cells specific for viral proteins are present in the CNS of mice infected with JHM suggests that this is indeed the case s.
Although infectious virus is recovered only rarely from animals after resolution of the acute disease, a few reports have demonstrated virus or viral antigen or RNA persisting in mice months after infection 9-11.
Because it has been shown that the poly(A) tail length of BCoV DI RNA within infected cells at 48 hpt (VP0) is similar to that of packaged BCoV DI RNA in inoculum collected at the same time point [16], the poly(A) tail length of DI RNA in infected cells may represent that in inoculum at 48 hpt (VP0).
Under this criterion and based on the results that (i) the coronaviral poly(A) tail length of DI RNA W-15A increased from 8 nts at 48 hpt (VP0) to 10 nts at 8 hpi of VP1 and (ii) the tail length of W-0A and W-5A remained the same during VP0 and VP1, we conclude that the minimum poly(A) tail length required to initiate tail lengthening of coronavirus DI RNA may lie between 5 and 9 nts during the natural infection of VP1, regardless of the length of the input DI RNA transcript.
Moreover, the level of lengthening was found to be correlated to the initial length of the poly(A) tail; that is, DI RNA with a longer poly(A) tail (for example, W-25A) showed a better lengthening than that with a shorter poly(A) tail (for example, W-15A), as evidenced by the comparison of poly(A) tail lengths synthesized at 48h of VP0 and 8h of VP1 for these DI RNA constructs during infection (Fig 1B).
Because the poly(A) tail length of DI RNA became varied after transfection (Fig 1B) and the DI RNA poly(A) tail length at 48 hpt (VP0) in infected cells was similar to that of packaged DI RNA in inoculum [16], we also applied RT-PCR and sequencing to identify the poly(A) tail length of R-20A at 48 hpt (VP0).
To further determine whether, besides hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail length, the DI RNA stability, replication efficiency and recombination are also factors affecting the synthesis of poly(A) tail on DI RNA, DI RNAs W-25A, R-5A, R-15A and R-20A with various length of synthesized poly(A) tail (24, 0, 3 and 18 nts, respectively) at 24 hpi of VP1 (Fig 3C) were selected and tested.In order to precisely identify the minimum requirement to initiate the lengthening of poly(A) tail, instead of constructing DI RNA with long ply(A) tail, for example, W-65A with 65 nts of poly(A) tail [16], several DI RNAs with a little variation in poly(A) tail length were constructed and therefore only a small variation in poly(A) tail length from these DI RNA constructs was expected in the process of infection as shown in Fig 1.
##Summary of Cluster4
Whereas development of anti-cancer and anti-viral nucleosides has typically involved relatively minor modification of the base, studies to examine expanding the genetic code and elucidate how polymerases differentiate right from wrong (d)NTPs have involved both small and large base modifications (Berdis and McCutcheon, 2007 , Cavanaugh, et al., 2009 , Henry, et al., 2004 , Kim, et al., 2005 , Kincaid, et al., 2005 , Kool, 2002 , Leconte, et al., 2008 , Lee and Berdis, 2009 , Lee, et al., 2008 , Matsuda, et al., 2003 , Meyer, et al., 2004 , Morales and Kool, 1998 , Ogawa, et al., 2000 , Patro, et al., 2009 , Ramirez-Aguilar and Kuchta, 2004 , Sintim and Kool, 2006 , Thompson and Kuchta, 1995 , Washington, et al., 2003 , Zhang, et al., 2005 .
The most extensive data on the effects of substrate modifications exists for Klenow Fragment (an A family enzyme), herpes and human DNA primase, and three B family polymerases (Pol α, herpes DNA pol, and T4 DNA pol) (Berdis and McCutcheon, 2007 , Cavanaugh, et al., 2009 , Henry, et al., 2004 , Kim, et al., 2005 , Kincaid, et al., 2005 , Kool, 2002 , Leconte, et al., 2008 , Lee and Berdis, 2009 , Lee, et al., 2008 , Matsuda, et al., 2003 , Meyer, et al., 2004 , Morales and Kool, 1998 , Ogawa, et al., 2000 , Patro, et al., 2009 , Ramirez-Aguilar and Kuchta, 2004 , Sintim and Kool, 2006 , Thompson and Kuchta, 1995 , Washington, et al., 2003 , Zhang, et al., 2005 .

However, studies in clinical trials and large animal models, including our studies, which delivered AAV2-TNFRII-FC into baboon hearts (McTiernan et al., 2007) , have revealed a range of inflammatory immune responses to AAV vectors and their transgene products, which may reduce transgene expression (Herzog et al., 2001 (Herzog et al., , 2002 Wang et al., 2005 Wang et al., , 2007a Jiang et al., 2006; Manno et al., 2006; Mingozzi and High, 2007) and raise the risks associated with AAV-based gene delivery procedures.
Direct injection of AAV into primate hearts (McTiernan et al., 2007) and dog skeletal muscle (Yuasa et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005 Wang et al., , 2007a induces a cellular infiltration, whereas the inflammatory response to catheterdelivered cardiac AAV infusion is not notable (Kaplitt et al., 1996; Kawase et al., 2008; Raake et al., 2008) .
In this light it is interesting to note that (1) several studies have observed an unexpected and prolonged (weeks to months) persistence of, and cellular responses to, viral antigens after infection with parvovirus B19 (Isa et al., 2005) , vesicular stomatitis virus (Turner et al., 2007) , or influenza virus (Kim et al., 2010);  (2) some studies suggest long-term persistence of AAV-antigens after viral delivery ( Jiang et al., 2006; Stieger et al., 2009) ; and (3) even low levels of viral capsid antigen:MHC complexes can target cells for recognition by peptide-specific cytotoxic T cells (Pien et al., 2009) .
Additionally, delivery of the S antigen by way of DNA vaccination, nanoparticles, recombinant viral vectors such as modified vaccinia Ankara or adenovirus or RBD-based subunit vaccines have shown immunogenicity and efficacy in mice and/or NHPs against MERS-CoV challenge (Du et al., 2013b; Muthumani et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Coleman et al., 2014; Song et al., 2013; Volz et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2014 Lan et al., , 2015 .
Finally, an eIF4E level increase was observed in the following human tumors: breast, bladder, colon, lung, skin, head and neck, ovarian, and prostate cancer, compared to healthy tissues (Berkel et al., 2001; Coleman et al., 2009; Crew et al., 2000; Graff et al., 2009; Holm et al., 2008; Matthews-Greer et al., 2005; Nathan et al., 2004; Salehi, Mashayekhi, & Shahosseini, 2007; Thumma & Kratzke, 2007; Wang et al., 2009) .
##Summary of Cluster5
Until recently, filoviruses were exclusively isolated from humans (Marburg virus, MARV; Ravn virus, RAVV; Bundibugyo virus, BDBV; Ebola virus, EBOV; Sudan virus, SUDV; Taï Forest virus, TAFV), crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis Raffles, 1821) (Reston virus, RESTV) and western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus Schwarz, 1934) (Taï Forest virus, TAFV).
A variety of viruses have been identified in alpacas, including bovine viral diarrhea virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, equine viral arteritis virus, rotavirus, rabies, bluetongue virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, bovine papillomavirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, West Nile virus, and equine herpesvirus [12, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .

The increased sensitivity with the use of a nested PCR can range from 10 to 1000 times; however, this technique also Detect both viral particles and soluble antigens Direct ELISA was shown to be a sensitive technique (detection limit of 0.025 ng of capsid protein and 1:10,000 dilutions of viral antigen in the stools) Useful for rapid screening of multiple faecal samples High specificity in VLP-based EIAs (the circulation of antigenically distinct NoV strains may lead to underestimated result interpretations) Cross-reaction of porcine NoV VLP-based antibody ELISA with human NoV antibodies Source: Wang et al.
##Summary of Cluster6
Although human IFN-ω (HuIFN-ω) can exert in vivo antitumor effects in several models of human cancer (Horton et al., 1999) , Feline IFN-ω (FeIFN-ω) shows a proven antiviral effect, both in vitro (Mochizuki et al., 1994; Ohe et al., 2008; Litzlbauer et al., 2014) and in vivo Leal et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2002; Horton et al., 1999; Mochizuki et al., 1994; Ohe et al., 2008; Litzlbauer et al., 2014) , against canine and feline parvovirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus, and has been licensed for use in veterinary medicine (Virbagen®, Virbac) in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico (Domenech et al., 2011) .
1999; Cornilescu et al., 1999; Case, 2001, 2002; Meiler 2003; Neal et al., 2003; Vila et al., 2003 Vila et al., , 2004 Berjanskii et al., 2005 Berjanskii et al., , 2007 Shen and Bax, 2007; Villegas et al., 2007; Vila et al., 2007a Vila et al., ,b, 2008a Shen et al., 2008; Han et al., 2011; Frank et al., 2012) and, therefore, can be used as an exquisitely sensitive probe with which to assess the quality of protein models.
It is worth noting that the theory, and details, behind alternative protein structure determination and validation methods are not discussed here and, hence, the reader is referred instead to an extensive collection of such methods (Vriend, 1990; Günter et al., 1991; Lüthy et al., 1992; Laskowski et al., 1993; Günter 1998; Cornilescu et al., 1998; Brünger et al., 1998; Lovell et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2005 Huang et al., , 2006 Nabuurs et al., 2006; Brünger, 2007; Davis et al., 2007; Bhattacharya et al, 2007; Cavalli, et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2008; Günter 2009; Rosato et al., 2009; Frank et al., 2011; Guerry and Herrmann, 2011; Rosatto et al., 2012) .
For each amino acid residue X in the protein sequence: (a) the 13 C α shielding depends, mainly, on its own backbone conformations (Spera and Bax, 1991; deDios et al., 1993; Kuszewski et al., 1995) and side-chain (Iwadate et al., 1999; Havlin et al., 1997; Pearson et al., 1997; Villegas et al., 2007) , with no significant influence of either the amino acid sequence or the position of the given residue in the sequence, except for residues preceding proline ; (b) each amino acid residue X in the protein sequence can be treated as a terminally blocked tripeptide with the sequence Ac-GXG-NMe, with X in the conformation of the protein structure; (c) the 13 C α isotropic shielding values (σ) for each amino acid residue X can be computed at the OB98/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory with the Gaussian 03 package (Frisch et al., 2004) .
Subsequently, use of NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and theoretical studies, based on QM calculations, have continuously evolved in their ability to determine properties of the histidine residues in solution and in the solid state (Meadow et al., 1968; Reynolds et al., 1973; Markley 1975; Wüthrich, 1976; Schuster and Roberts, 1979; Harbison et al., 1981; Munowitz et al., 1986; Bachovchin, 1986; Farr-Jones et al., 1993; Pelton et al., 1993; Steiner, 1996; Steiner and Koellner, 1997; Shimba et al., 1998 Shimba et al., , 2003 Sudmeier et al., 2003; Strohmeier et al., 2003; Cheng et al., 2005; Shimahara et al., 2007; Jensen et al., 2007; Hass et al., 2008; Hass et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2010; Vila et al., 2011) .

##Summary of Cluster7
One year on, in 2004, ‘comprehensive collective security’—described as a ‘new and broader understanding’ of international security—provided the overall vision behind the report of the UN Secretary General's High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.25 The Panel prescribed an improvement in public health systems, arguing that:
emergence of new infectious diseases, a resurgence of older diseases and a spread of resistance to a growing number of mainstay antibiotic drugs … signify a dramatic decay in local and global public health capacity.26
It also warned that ‘the security of the most affluent State can be held hostage to the ability of the poorest State to contain an emerging disease’.27 And, controversially, it suggested a new role for the UN Security Council: in its view, in ‘extreme cases of threat posed by a new emerging infectious disease or international release of an infectious agent’,28 it would be appropriate for the Security Council to help with the implementation of control measures.
The new Regulations take what has been described as an ‘“all risks” approach’,34 encompassing any emergency with repercussions for international health security, including outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, outbreaks of food borne disease, natural disasters, and the accidental or deliberate release of pathogens, or chemical or radio-nuclear materials.35 Their purpose is to:
prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.36
To give effect to this, they place obligations on Member States with respect to surveillance and response capacities; States are also obliged to notify WHO of events within their territories that may constitute a ‘public health emergency of international concern’.37
But what of human rights?
So, for example, WHO recommendations to States Parties, and health measures implemented by States Parties in response to identifiable risks, must be ‘no more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection’.39 The IHR also give WHO a new power to use information about disease outbreaks provided by unofficial sources (for example, non-governmental organisations or individual scientists).40 Significantly, WHO has described this new power as a ‘revolutionary departure from previous international conventions and regulations’.41
So, how should a human rights lawyer respond to the panoply of new linkages between health and security and, more specifically, the increasing focus on public health emergency preparedness?

• Pooled procurement, using limited competitive bidding (tender) • Pooled procurement (or use of monopsony power), with price negotiation based on volumes procured or inclusion in a reimbursement list • Parallel importation Pro-generic policies (note that these policies also rely on an eff ective medicines regulatory authority, which can assure the quality of all products on the local market) • International non-proprietary name prescribing • Mandatory off er of generic substitution or enablement of generic substitution by pharmacists and other dispensers
• Reduction or removal of import taxes or sales taxes • Internal reference pricing (note that this type of pricing is also a pro-generic policy, as it depends on the ability to set a reimbursement limit by reference to the price of a selected generic option) • External reference pricing • Regulation of distribution chain mark-ups • Regulation of professional fees • Regulation of annual factory-gate price increases • Patent-related interventions such as encouragement of voluntary licensing and patent pools
• Evidence-informed standard treatment guidelines and essential medicines list or reimbursement list • Feedback on prescribing behaviour, with peer review and intervention • Reimbursement based on adherence to guidelines and use of medicines targets • Reimbursement caps (limit) • Patient copayments (as a disincentive to overuse)

The Use of the wrong medicine for the target indication and patient, or wrong use of the right medicine
Broad-spectrum antibiotics when narrow-spectrum antibiotics would suffi ce; teratogenic medicines used in pregnant women; coprescribing of absolutely contraindicated medicines; prescribing contraindicated medicines based on patient characteristics (eg, aspirin in children and adolescents for the treatment of fever); medicine dose not adjusted to patient age, weight, organ function; injections for patients who can swallow oral products; targeted cancer therapy use without confi rming presence of targets Unnecessary use of highly priced medicines
Use of a medicine that is more costly than a possibly equally eff ective and safe medicine Use of originator brand products and branded generics when lower-priced quality international nonproprietary name generic products could be used; use of second-line and third-line medicines when fi rst-line medicines should appropriately be tried fi rst; use of new and highly priced medicines of questionable added value, when an older, better-characterised medicine would suffi ce (eg, new oral and injectable options for type 2 diabetes, new analogue insulins for type 1 diabetes) *For some therapeutic groups, such as antibiotics, addressing inappropriate use requires key interventions outside the health sector (eg, agriculture), which have been described elsewhere.
