One year on, in 2004, ‘comprehensive collective security’—described as a ‘new and broader understanding’ of international security—provided the overall vision behind the report of the UN Secretary General's High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.25 The Panel prescribed an improvement in public health systems, arguing that:
emergence of new infectious diseases, a resurgence of older diseases and a spread of resistance to a growing number of mainstay antibiotic drugs … signify a dramatic decay in local and global public health capacity.26
It also warned that ‘the security of the most affluent State can be held hostage to the ability of the poorest State to contain an emerging disease’.27 And, controversially, it suggested a new role for the UN Security Council: in its view, in ‘extreme cases of threat posed by a new emerging infectious disease or international release of an infectious agent’,28 it would be appropriate for the Security Council to help with the implementation of control measures.
The new Regulations take what has been described as an ‘“all risks” approach’,34 encompassing any emergency with repercussions for international health security, including outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, outbreaks of food borne disease, natural disasters, and the accidental or deliberate release of pathogens, or chemical or radio-nuclear materials.35 Their purpose is to:
prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.36
To give effect to this, they place obligations on Member States with respect to surveillance and response capacities; States are also obliged to notify WHO of events within their territories that may constitute a ‘public health emergency of international concern’.37
But what of human rights?
So, for example, WHO recommendations to States Parties, and health measures implemented by States Parties in response to identifiable risks, must be ‘no more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection’.39 The IHR also give WHO a new power to use information about disease outbreaks provided by unofficial sources (for example, non-governmental organisations or individual scientists).40 Significantly, WHO has described this new power as a ‘revolutionary departure from previous international conventions and regulations’.41
So, how should a human rights lawyer respond to the panoply of new linkages between health and security and, more specifically, the increasing focus on public health emergency preparedness?

The Use of the wrong medicine for the target indication and patient, or wrong use of the right medicine
Broad-spectrum antibiotics when narrow-spectrum antibiotics would suffi ce; teratogenic medicines used in pregnant women; coprescribing of absolutely contraindicated medicines; prescribing contraindicated medicines based on patient characteristics (eg, aspirin in children and adolescents for the treatment of fever); medicine dose not adjusted to patient age, weight, organ function; injections for patients who can swallow oral products; targeted cancer therapy use without confi rming presence of targets Unnecessary use of highly priced medicines
Use of a medicine that is more costly than a possibly equally eff ective and safe medicine Use of originator brand products and branded generics when lower-priced quality international nonproprietary name generic products could be used; use of second-line and third-line medicines when fi rst-line medicines should appropriately be tried fi rst; use of new and highly priced medicines of questionable added value, when an older, better-characterised medicine would suffi ce (eg, new oral and injectable options for type 2 diabetes, new analogue insulins for type 1 diabetes) *For some therapeutic groups, such as antibiotics, addressing inappropriate use requires key interventions outside the health sector (eg, agriculture), which have been described elsewhere.
