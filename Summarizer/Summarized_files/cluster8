Indications for the use or consideration of a long-term controller medication for the 0â€“4-year-old age group also includes the following:More than three episodes of wheezing that lasted longer than 1 day within the past year and risk factors for developing asthma, including (1) atopic dermatitis, (2) sensitization to aeroallergens, or (3) parental history of asthma or two of the following: food allergy, more than 4% blood eosinophilia, or wheezing in the absence of a viral respiratory infectionRequires symptomatic treatment 3 days or more weekly for more than 4 weeksRequired systemic corticosteroids for severe exacerbation of asthma two or more times within the last 6 months

In these situations, treatment with a daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid can help reduce exacerbations and decrease symptoms but does not appear to alter the future course of asthma severity.
On the 24 children with a negative FA result, 12 patients had a fever of undetermined origin, 2 patients had a urinary tract infection, one patient had measles, one patient had scarlet fever, one patient had rotavirus infection, one patient had a bacterial bronchopneumonia, one patient had a cutaneous infection and 5 patients had a diagnosis of a noninfectious disease.
Other studies did not find a difference in antibiotic use when testing adult or pediatric patients with molecular techniques (Hernes et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2015; Andrews et al., 2017; Semret et al., 2017; Trabattoni et al., 2018) ; however, some pediatric studies report a shorter antimicrobial treatment duration (Rogers et al., 2015; Schulert et al., 2013) .
For subjects enrolled in this study, the following data were collected: (1) basic patient information (age, sex, hospitalization period, and mortality rate), (2) past medical history with comorbid disease (any malignancy, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, asthma, previous Mycobacteria infection history, and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection history), (3) physical findings (body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and mental status), and (4) laboratory findings (bacterial culture results for any specimens, bacterial and viral antigen test, molecular test results of bacterial and viral pathogens, antibody test for M. pneumoniae, HIV screening assay, arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA), complete blood cell count (CBC), blood nitrogen urea (BUN), sodium, glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), chest radiographic findings, mechanical ventilation, immunocompromised status, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission).
Among 64 severe CAP patients, the bacterial and viral coinfections were confirmed in 14 patients (21.9%) in our study, and this result was similar with previous reports that showed about 16.6-39% in severe CAP or critically ill patients (Karhu et al., 2014; Martin-Loeches et al., 2017; Voiriot et al., 2016) .
According to the guideline of influenza A (H1N1) (2010 edition) issued by the Ministry of Health in China, the following populations tend to develop severe influenza A (H1N1) after the occurrence of influenza-like symptoms:PregnanciesPatients with the following diseases or conditions: chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases (with hypertension excluded), renal diseases, hepatic diseases, blood disorders, neurological diseases and neuromyopathies, metabolic disturbance and endocrinopathies, immunosuppression (including individuals using an immune suppressor or with immunodeficiency due to HIV infection), long-term use of aspirin, and under the age of 19 yearsObese persons with a body weight index exceeding 30Children under the age of 5 years, especially children under the age of 2 yearsThe elderly people aged above 65 yearsFor these five populations with influenza-like symptoms, focused attention should be paid clinically.
A case can be suspected with influenza A (H1N1) with at least one of the following conditions:A history of close contact to definitive case of influenza A (H1N1) that is in the infective stage within 7 days before the onset of flu-like symptoms; a close contact refers to diagnosing, treating, and attending patients with influenza A (H1N1) in the infective stage with no effective protection, living together with the patient, and contact to respiratory secretion or body fluid of the patient.Onset of influenza-like clinical manifestations, with influenza A (H1N1) virus positive but no further examination to define the viral subtype.For the cases with at least one of the above two conditions, etiological examinations should be performed to define the diagnosis.
